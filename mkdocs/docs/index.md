runcpp2 is a simple declarable, scriptable, flexible cross-platform build system build system for c or c++

- 🚀 **Simple**: `#!shell runcpp2 main.cpp`, this is all you need to get started
- 📝 **Declarable**: *Quick, Concise, Minimal* YAML format
- 🔧 **Scriptable**: *Customize, Run And Debug* your build pipeline with c++, or just use it as a script. 
                     No longer need to juggle between CMake, Python, Bash, Batch, Lua, etc...
- 🪜 **Flexible**: *YAML* for small project, *c++* for finer control


## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Any c or c++ compiler. The default user config only has g++ and msvc profiles. But feel free to
add other compilers.

## 📥️ Installation
You can either build from source or use the binary release

Binary Release (Only Linux and Windows for now): 
[https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/runcpp2/releases](https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/runcpp2/releases)

Nightly Release:
[https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/runcpp2/releases/tag/nightly](https://github.com/Neko-Box-Coder/runcpp2/releases/tag/nightly)

Finally, you just need to add runcpp2 binary location to the `PATH` environment variable and 
you can run c++ files anywhere you want.
